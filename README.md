To use the advertisement manager add the following namespace: 
      using `Moonee.MoonSDK.Internal.Advertisement;`


  ### Rewarded video ads API:
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>

  Note a change: Add Rewarded video name 
  
       void AdvertisementManager.ShowRewardedAd
       (
         [Action OnStartAdEvent = null],
         [Action OnFinishAdEvent = null],
         [Action OnFailAdEvent = null],
         [Action OnFinishRewardedVideowWithSuccessEvent = null]
       )
       
       AdvertisementManager.ShowRewardedAd(
        () => 
        {
            //Ad start logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Add finish logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Ad fail logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Add Reward logic
        }, 
        "rewardedVideoName"); // Add Rewarded video name
      
      Bool AdvertisementManager.IsRewardedAdReady()
      AdvertisementManager.IsRewardedAdReady();
</details>

  ### Interstitial ads API:
<details>

         [Action OnStartAdEvent = null],
         [Action OnFinishAdEvent = null],
         [Action OnFailAdEvent = null]
       )
       
       AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial(
        () =>
        {
            //Ad start logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Add finish logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Ad fail logic

</details>

</details>

## Events
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
A. [Analytic Events](#analytic-events)  
B. [Adjust UA Events](adjust-ua-events)  
C. [In-app purchase (IAP) Events](#in-app-purchase-iap-events)  
D. [Progression events](#progression-events)  
  
### Analytic Events
<details>
  <summary></summary>
With Moon SDK you can send custom events to various analytics services
  
       Void  MoonSDK.TrackCustomEvent("Event name", [Dictionary <string, object> eventProperties = null],
      [string type = null],
      [List < MoonSDK.AnalyticsProvider> analyticsProviders = null])
      
Call this method to track any custom event you want.  
eventName = the name of the event to track.  
Exsample:  
      
      MoonSDK.TrackCustomEvent("Event name", MoonSDK.AnalyticsProvider.Firebase);
  
</details>


### In-app purchase (IAP) Events:
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
To accurately monitor in-app purchase (IAP) revenue through Adjust, ensure you've configured the Adjust app token and the IAP revenue event token within the Moon SDK settings.
Go to receipt Validation Obfuscator , paste the google public key of your app and press ‚ÄúObfuscate Google Play License Key‚Äù.
Please ensure that the event is triggered from every available location where the product can be purchased. If users have the option to buy from both the in-game store and a popup, make sure the event is sent in both scenarios

In-app purchase (IAP) Event contains the following parameters:
1. `iAPType` - Refer to the different types of in-app purchaseS:
    A. `product` - A one-time purchase.
    B. `Subscription` - A product that allows users to purchase content for a defined period. 
3. `levelName` -  Specifies the level where the in-app purchase was made.
After each successful purchase you need to send event to adjust:

      public static async Task MoonSDK.TrackAdjustRevenueEventAsync(PurchaseEventArgs e, iAPType iAPType, string levelName = "default")
      await  MoonSDK.TrackAdjustRevenueEventAsync(product, iAPType.product, "0001");

Example:

      System.Threading.Tasks.Task task = MoonSDK.TrackAdjustRevenueEventAsync(args, subsription, $"{LevelNumber}");

</details>

### Progression Events
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
**Levels progression events using Adjust:**  
We utilize two key events related to game level progression: LevelDataStartEvent and LevelDataCompleteEvent.

`LevelDataStartEvent` is sent at the beginning of the level
1. `coinsAmount` - Indicates the main currency current amount (In level 1, if the users start with 0, send 0.)
2. `purchaseIDs` - Indicates which in-app purchases the user made before starting this level, since the last time this event was sent.

Use it as described below:

     MoonSDK.SendLevelDataStartEvent(levelIndex, coinsAmount, purchaseIDs);


`LevelDataCompleteEvent`  is sent at the end of the level:
1. `LevelStatus` - Indicates the current status of the level, which could be "start" when the level begins, "fail" if the player fails to complete it, or "complete" if the player finishes it without winning.
2. `levelIndex` - Indicates level index
3. `LevelResult` - Represents the outcome of the level, which could be "win" if the player successfully completes it or "fail" if the player fails to complete it.
4. `isContinue` - A boolean argument that indicates whether the player is continuing the level from where they left off (true) or starting it from the beginning (false). This is particularly useful for long idle levels or when there's a revive   
     option. If the game doesn't have these features, it should be set to false by default.
5. `coinsAmount` - Shows the current amount of the main currency once the level is completed.

Use it as described below:

     MoonSDK.SendLevelDataCompleteEvent(LevelStatus.complete, levelIndex, LevelResult.win, isContinue, coinsAmount);


For the in game store data, use the following (the rest is aoutomatic):

      MoonSDK.OpenInGameStore(); // Execute when user opens the store
      MoonSDK.CloseInGameStore(); // Execute when user closes the store

      

For the in game store data, use the following (the rest is aoutomatic):

      MoonSDK.OpenInGameStore(); // Execute when user opens the store
      MoonSDK.CloseInGameStore(); // Execute when user closes the store

      
**Levels progression events using GameAnalytics:**  


      void MoonSDK.TrackLevelEvents(MoonSDK.LevelEvents eventType, int levelIndex);
      MoonSDK.TrackLevelEvents(MoonSDK.LevelEvents.Start, 1);


**Note**: In this part it is crutial to check:  
     - **A.** Token to Adjust for EACH event  
     - **B.**  No spaces before and after the token 
</details>
</details>

## Firebase Configuration
<details>
  <summary></summary>

**We utilize Firebase for two primary purposes:**

1. User Acquisition: To facilitate proper integration within Google platforms, event data needs to be stored in Firebase.
2. A/B Testing via Remote Config: This powerful tool enables remote modification of parameters.

**Workflow:**

1. A designated team member, typically the Product Manager, will initiate a Firebase project for your game (do not create one yourself, as it may lead to improper UA usage).
2. You will receive configuration files (google-services.json for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS).
3. Integrate these files into your Unity project following the instructions provided below.


  
![UnityFirebase](images/AddingFirebaseToUnity.png)
![AssetesStreaming](images/AssetesStreamings.png)

**Firebase Remote Config** 

Moon SDK by default uses some default remote config values:

1. `int_grace_time`: Interstitials Grace Time - time (in seconds) from app first use until first INT.
2. `Int_grace_level: Interstitials Grace Level-  after which level first INT will be shown.
3. `cooldown_between_INTs`: Cooldown Between Interstitials -  timer (in seconds) for spaces between INTs.
4. `cooldown_after_RVs`: Cooldown After Rewarded Videos- time (in seconds) for INT AFTER watching a Rewarded video.( Replace cooldown_between_int ).
5. `Show_int_if_fail`: Show Interstitial If Fail 	
`True`: player gets ads after each level, regardless of success status,
`False`:  player gets ads after success levels only.
6. `INT_in_stage`: Interstitials In Stage,
`True`: player gets ads during stages
`False`: player gets ads after stages only

**Default values:**
`int_grace_time`: 30 sec
`Int_grace_level`: 1 level
`cooldown_between_INTs`: 20 sec
`cooldown_after_RVs`: 20 sec
`Show_int_if_fail`: False
`INT_in_stage`: False

Note that `int_grace_time`, `cooldown_between_INTs`, `cooldown_after_RVs` are managed automatically by Moon SDK and you don‚Äôt need to do anything with that, but the rest values you need to check before showing ads.


       if(currentLevel > RemoteConfigValues.int_grace_level)
        {
            AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial();
        }



      if(RemoteConfigValues.Show_int_if_fail == true)
        {
            AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial();
        }


      if(RemoteConfigValues.INT_in_stage == true)
        {
            AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial();
        }

</details>

## CMP - GDPR Consent
<details>
  <summary></summary>
We utilize a CMP (Consent Management Platform) solution to obtain consent from users.   
Effective CMP implementations can potentially boost the value of users engaging with the game, potentially adding up to 50% of the ad's worth.
  
To use CMP in your project you need to fill in the Adjust Consent Token:  
![consentToken](images/consentToken.png)    

Consent precedes any other aspect of the SDK and the tutorial. We are dedicated to compliance with the highest regulatory standards in Europe, as outlined by the GDPR enforced by the IAB. Therefore, we are unable to implement the best practice of obtaining consent after the tutorial.
The CMP popup appears as follows: 
<details>
 <summary>ConsentPopUp</summary>
  
![welcome](images/welcome.png) 

</details>

Below you will find a code example how to pop up the consent window from your game,you will need to mute sounds and stop any ad timers.   
Create a consent button in settings screen in your game.  

![consentSetting](images/consent_setting.png)    


      private void ConsentsButtonPressed()
    {
        CMP.OpenSettingsScreen();
        CMP.eventHandler += OnConsentsChangesEventListener; // Don't forget to unsubscribe, you can use OnDestroy method for example
        // AdvertisementManager.PauseInterstitialTimer();
        // AudioController.PauseMusic(true);
    }
    private void OnConsentsChangesEventListener(int id, TCData TCData, bool isSuccess)
    {
        //AdvertisementManager.ResumeInterstitialTimer();
        //AudioController.PauseMusic(false);
    }

Check if the user is in the GDPR country

    if(!CheckGDPRCountry.CheckCountryForGDPR())
        {
    //Disable cmp pop-up
        } 

        
</details>  

## In-Game Fonts
<details>
  <summary></summary>  
In terms of in-game fonts, they must be official fonts from Google Fonts or Liberation Sans from Unity. Follow these steps to ensure compliance with font licensing:

1. Use only fonts from the Google Fonts library or Liberation Sans from Unity.
2. After selecting the relevant font, ensure you have the license for the game code as a text file.
3. Rename the license file to the following format: `Fontname_license.txt`.
4. Place both the font file and its license file in the Fonts directory of your project.
5. The most common font licenses are OFL (Open Font License) and Apache License.
6. Copy everything in the StreamingAssets directory to add a new licensed font, which will be automatically added to the build.
7. Fonts from Google Fonts can be used for both Android and iOS games. You can find them at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
8. Unity typically has two built-in fonts:
   * Liberation Sans (free to use)
   * Arial (note: Arial is not free to use)
9. Refer to the following guides for embedding custom fonts in games:
   * Unity - Manual: [Font Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Font.html).

By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure that your game uses licensed fonts responsibly and legally.
