## Downloading MOON SDK
<details>
  <summary></summary>

  The current version of the MOON SDK is version 1.4.0.3    (Slack bot is sending the link) 
  
</details>
  

## Setting Up Moon SDK
<details>
  <summary></summary>

  1. Import MoonSDK.unitypackage into your unity project.
  
  2. Please note, that our SDK uses some iAP features, so iAP package should be installed from the package manager
  
  3. The MoonSDKScene must be the first in the list in the build settings, after initialization it will load the next scene in the list (with index 1).

     ![MoonSDKScene](images/MoonSDKScene.png)
     
  4. Open MoonSDK settings and fill in all app keys for analytics and advertising services which you want to use and press Check and Sync Settings button
    
     ![SyncSettings](images/SyncSettings.png)
</details>
 
## Initialization
<details>
  <summary></summary>
Moon SDK is initialized automatically from the Moon SDK scene.
</details>

## Displaying Ads
<details>
  <summary></summary>

MoonSDK does support the following ad formats:

A. [Rewarded Video Ads](#rewarded-video-ads-api)  
B. [Interstitial Ads](#interstitial-ads-api)  
C. [Banner Ads](#banner-ads-api)

To use the advertisement manager add the following namespace: 
      using `Moonee.MoonSDK.Internal.Advertisement;`


  ### Rewarded video ads API:
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
        AdvertisementManager.ShowRewardedAd(
        () => 
        {
            //Ad start logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Add finish logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Ad fail logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Add Reward logic
        });
      
        AdvertisementManager.IsRewardedAdReady();
</details>

  ### Interstitial ads API:
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>

        double timeLeftForNextAd = AdvertisementManager.InterstitialTimer;
        AdvertisementManager.IsInterstitialdAdReady();
        
        AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial(
        () =>
        {
            //Ad start logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Add finish logic
        },
        () =>
        {
            //Ad fail logic
        });

</details>

  ### Banner Ads API:
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>

      AdvertisementManager.ShowBanner();
      AdvertisementManager.HideBanner();
      
</details>

</details>

## Events
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
A. [Analytic Events](#analytic-events)  
B. [In-app purchase (IAP) Events](#in-app-purchase-iap-events)  
C. [Progression events](#progression-events)  
  
### Analytic Events
<details>
  <summary></summary>
With Moon SDK you can send custom events to various analytics services
  
       Void  MoonSDK.TrackCustomEvent("Event name", [Dictionary <string, object> eventProperties = null],
      [string type = null],
      [List < MoonSDK.AnalyticsProvider> analyticsProviders = null])
      
Call this method to track any custom event you want.  
eventName = the name of the event to track.  
Example:  
      
      MoonSDK.TrackCustomEvent("Event name", MoonSDK.AnalyticsProvider.Firebase);
  
</details>


### In-app purchase (IAP) Events:
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
To accurately monitor in-app purchase (IAP) revenue through Adjust, ensure you've configured the Adjust app token and the IAP revenue event token within the Moon SDK settings.
Go to receipt Validation Obfuscator , paste the google public key of your app and press ‚ÄúObfuscate Google Play License Key‚Äù.
Please ensure that the event is triggered from every available location where the product can be purchased. If users have the option to buy from both the in-game store and a popup, make sure the event is sent in both scenarios

After each successful purchase you need to send event to adjust:

      public static  MoonSDK.TrackAdjustRevenueEvent(PurchaseEventArgs e, iAPType iAPType, string levelNumber)

Example:

       MoonSDK.TrackAdjustRevenueEventAsync(args, subsription, "4");

</details>

### Progression Events
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
**Levels progression events using Adjust:**  
We utilize two key events related to game level progression: LevelDataStartEvent and LevelDataCompleteEvent.

`LevelDataStartEvent` is sent at the begginig of the level.

1. `levelNumber` - Indicates the current level number
2. `coinsAmount` - Represents the amount of soft currency when the level is finished
3. `purchaseIDs` - A long string that represents the IAP (In-App Purchase) IDs made during the level

Use it as described below:

     MoonSDK.SendLevelDataStartEvent(levelNumber, coinsAmount, purchaseIDs);

`LevelDataCompleteEvent`  is sent at the end of the level:

1. `levelNumber` - Indicates the current level number
2. `result` - Represents the outcome of the level, which could be "win" if the player successfully completes it or "fail" if the player fails to complete it.
3. `isContinueLevel` - A boolean argument that indicates whether the player is continuing the level from where they left off (true) or starting it from the beginning (false). This is particularly useful for long idle levels or when there's a revive option. If the game doesn't have these features, it should be set to false by default.
4. `coinsAmount` - Represents the amount of soft currency when the level is finished
5. `moves` - Represents the number of moves made during the level
6. `customParameters` - This is a Dictionary<string, string> where you can track your own custom parameters. The key represents the parameter name, and the value represents the actual value of the parameter

Use it as described below:

     MoonSDK.SendLevelDataCompleteEvent(LevelStatus.complete, levelNumber, LevelResult.win, isContinueLevel, customParamsDictionary);

For the in game store data, use the following (the rest is aoutomatic):

      MoonSDK.OpenInGameStore(); // Execute when user opens the store
      MoonSDK.CloseInGameStore(); // Execute when user closes the store

      
**Note**: In this part, it is crucial to check:  
     - **A.** Token to Adjust for EACH event  
     - **B.** No spaces before and after the token 
</details>
</details>

## Firebase Configuration
<details>
  <summary></summary>

**We utilize Firebase for two primary purposes:**

1. User Acquisition: To ensure seamless integration with Google platforms, event data must be stored in Firebase.
2. A/B Testing via Remote Config: This powerful tool allows for remote modification of parameters, enabling more effective experimentation.

**Workflow:**

1. A designated team member, typically the Product Manager, will initiate a Firebase project for your game. Do not create one yourself, as it may result in improper user acquisition (UA) usage.
2. You will receive the configuration files: google-services.json for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS.
3. Integrate these files into your Unity project by following the instructions provided below.

![UnityFirebase](images/AddingFirebaseToUnity.png)
![AssetesStreaming](images/AssetesStreamings.png)

**Firebase Remote Config** 

Moon SDK by default uses some default remote config values:

1. `int_grace_time`: Interstitials Grace Time - time (in seconds) from app first use until first INT.
2. `Int_grace_level: Interstitials Grace Level-  after which level first INT will be shown.
3. `cooldown_between_INTs`: Cooldown Between Interstitials -  timer (in seconds) for spaces between INTs.
4. `cooldown_after_RVs`: Cooldown After Rewarded Videos- time (in seconds) for INT AFTER watching a Rewarded video.( Replace cooldown_between_int ).
5. `Show_int_if_fail`: Show Interstitial If Fail 	
`True`: player gets ads after each level, regardless of success status,
`False`:  player gets ads after success levels only.
6. `INT_in_stage`: Interstitials In Stage,
`True`: player gets ads during stages
`False`: player gets ads after stages only

**Default values:**
`int_grace_time`: 30 sec
`int_grace_level`: 1 level
`cooldown_between_INTs`: 20 sec
`cooldown_after_RVs`: 20 sec
`show_int_if_fail`: False
`int_in_stage`: False

Note that `int_grace_time`, `cooldown_between_INTs`, `cooldown_after_RVs` are managed automatically by Moon SDK and you don‚Äôt need to do anything with that, but the rest values you need to check before showing ads.


        if(currentLevel > RemoteConfigValues.int_grace_level)
        {
            AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial();
        }



        if(RemoteConfigValues.Show_int_if_fail == true)
        {
            AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial();
        }


        if(RemoteConfigValues.INT_in_stage == true)
        {
            AdvertisementManager.ShowInterstitial();
        }

</details>

## CMP - GDPR Consent
<details>
  <summary></summary>
We utilize a CMP (Consent Management Platform) solution to obtain consent from users.   
Effective CMP implementations can potentially boost the value of users engaging with the game, potentially adding up to 50% of the ad's worth.
  
To use CMP in your project you need to fill in the Adjust Consent Token:  
![consentToken](images/consentToken.png)    
  
Below you will find a code example how to pop up the consent window from your game,you will need to mute sounds and stop any ad timers.   
Create a consent button in settings screen in your game.

      private void ConsentsButtonPressed()
    {
        CMP.OpenSettingsScreen();
        CMP.eventHandler += OnConsentsChangesEventListener; // Don't forget to unsubscribe, you can use OnDestroy method for example
        // AdvertisementManager.PauseInterstitialTimer();
        // AudioController.PauseMusic(true);
    }
    private void OnConsentsChangesEventListener(int id, TCData TCData, bool isSuccess)
    {
        //AdvertisementManager.ResumeInterstitialTimer();
        //AudioController.PauseMusic(false);
    }

Check if the user is in the GDPR country

    if(!CheckGDPRCountry.CheckCountryForGDPR())
        {
    //Disable cmp pop-up
        } 

        
</details>  

## In-Game Fonts
<details>
  <summary></summary>  
In terms of in-game fonts, they must be official fonts from Google Fonts or Liberation Sans from Unity. Follow these steps to ensure compliance with font licensing:

1. Use only fonts from the Google Fonts library or Liberation Sans from Unity.
2. After selecting the relevant font, ensure you have the license for the game code as a text file.
3. Rename the license file to the following format: `Fontname_license.txt`.
4. Place both the font file and its license file in the Fonts directory of your project.
5. The most common font licenses are OFL (Open Font License) and Apache License.
6. Copy everything in the StreamingAssets directory to add a new licensed font, which will be automatically added to the build.
7. Fonts from Google Fonts can be used for both Android and iOS games. You can find them at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
8. Unity typically has two built-in fonts:
   * Liberation Sans (free to use)
   * Arial (note: Arial is not free to use)
9. Refer to the following guides for embedding custom fonts in games:
   * Unity - Manual: [Font Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Font.html).

By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure that your game uses licensed fonts responsibly and legally.
